## Quick Guide

On opening the calculator this is what you should see.

From here by clicking the number keys you can enter a value.

From here clicking either an operator (+, -, x, /, %) or the equals button will shift the value across and you may enter another value.

Once you have entered a second value you may select an operator and the result of your calculation will be displayed

In this state pressing the equals key will move the result to the top-right, and you may enter another value for a further calculation, as will pressing any number value.

You may also cancel any inputs you have entered by pressing the C key. This will clear the current input and result, leaving the previously calculated value. Or by pressing the CE key which will clear everything, returning you to the initial state.

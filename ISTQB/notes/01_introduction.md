K Levels

* K1 (Remember) = The candidate should remember or recognize a term or concept
* K2 (Understand) = The candidate should select an explanation for a statement related to the question topic.
* K3 (Apply) = The candidate should select the correct application or technique and apply it to a given context

## Introduction

Why do you need software testing ? - To build a more robust application overall, to ensure the application meets the specification.

## Key Testing Terms

**Test Basis:** Body of knowledge used as the basis for test analysis and design

**Test Conditions:** An aspect of the test basis that is relevant in order to achieve specific test objectives.

**Test Case:** A set of pre-conditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected results and post conditions, developed based on test conditions.

**Test Procedure:** A sequence of test cases in execution order, and any associated actions that may be required to set up the initial pre-conditions and any wrap up activities post execution

**Error (mistake):** Something made by a human, getting the wrong requirements

**Defect (fault):** Mismatch between expected and actual.

**Failure:** 

**Root Cause vs. Effect**

## Debugging and Testing

Debugging - used by developers to identify the cause of bugs or defects in code and undertake corrections.

Testing - systematic exploration of a component or system with the main aim of finding and reporting defects.

## Seven Testing Principles

1. Testing shows the presence of bugs
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing
4. Defect clustering
5. The pesticide paradox 
6. Testing is context dependant
7. Absence of errors fallacy

## Testing's Contribution to Success

Early detection of defect in work products

Testers and system designers have better understanding of the system's design and how to test it.

Testers and developers have better understanding of the code and how to test it

Having testers verify and validate the software prior to release can detect failures that might otherwise have been missed.

## Developer/Tester Mindset

Be nice

## QA vs Testing

**Quality Assurance** is typically focused on adherence to proper processes, as to provide confidence that appropriate levels of quality will be achieved (i.e. processes to prevent possible bugs during software development)

**Quality Control** involves various activities, including test activities, that support the achievement of appropriate levels of quality.

**Testing** is a way of checking that the way the system operates and find the possible defects. Can be seen as part of QA.

**Quality Management** ties testing and quality assurance together. Includes both quality assurance and quality control.

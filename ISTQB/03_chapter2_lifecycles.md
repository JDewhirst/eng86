# Project Lifecycles

## Waterfall

System reqs -> Software reqs -> Analysis -> Program design -> Coding -> Testing -> Operations

### Cons

- Do not always know what client wants
- Estimations of times costs are difficult
- What's requested cannot always be created
- Division of labour is not realistic

### Pros

- Enforces discipline at each stage
- Has a defined start and end 
- something else

## V-Model

Extension of the waterfall model. Testers should review documents as soon as drafts are available. Check docs against user requirements.

Integrates testing into the whole dev process. At each stage of dev an equal stage of testing should take place. Test prep can e separated from test execution.

### Pros

* Higher chance of success as test plans are developed earlier
* Defects found earlier
* Works very well on smaller projects

### Cons

- Quite rigid in execution
- No early prototype
- Test documents have to be updated along the way

There is a 5th testing level in the V-model: System Integration Testing.

## Agile (Scrum, Kanban, RUP, Spiral)

### Pros

* Small and frequent improvements
* Fast deployment
* Team skill improvement

### Cons

* Light documentation
* Formal records of change may not be created
* Regression testing may get out of control
